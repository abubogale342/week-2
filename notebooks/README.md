# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Usage

1. Ensure Jupyter is installed (included in requirements.txt)
2. Start Jupyter from the project root:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
   ```
3. Open the notebook you want to work with

## Guidelines

- Keep notebooks focused on a single task or analysis
- Document your code with markdown cells
- Consider converting stable analysis into Python modules in the `src/` directory
- Clear all outputs before committing
